# SICP-Solutions
A repository containing solutions to the exercises presented in the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Abelson, Sussman and Sussman.

DrRacket 8.2 with the sicp language pack is being used, i.e. #lang sicp is at the top of every program.

All solutions are my own work except where noted.
